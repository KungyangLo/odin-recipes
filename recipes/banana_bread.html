<p>
    Awesome banana bread that is to die for. Dark brown sugar is key (keeping the bread ultra tender and moist), and a dollop of mascarpone (which you can sub with sour cream or yogurt if desired) makes for superior tenderness in the crumb. Chocolate and walnuts are optional but encouraged.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Nonstick vegetable oil spray</li>
    <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1¼ teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup mascarpone, plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, or sour cream</li>
    <li>¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>4 large very ripe bananas, mashed (about 1½ cups)</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate (optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat 8½x4½" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a generous overhang on long sides. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar, mascarpone, and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed.</li>
    <li>Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Add bananas and mix just until combined. Fold in chocolate and/or walnuts, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.</li>
    <li>Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–65 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 1 hour. Turn out bread and let cool completely (if you can resist) before slicing.</li>
